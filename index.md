### Coding Projects

[ThinSat Project](https://github.com/jbernard3396/ET-Sat)
Taylor University Computer Science and Engineering departments teamed up to launch the first ever student built satelite into space. I had the extreme honor of being team lead of the Software Development team. I oversaw everything from the core kernel processes to the main loop. We had to coordinate with the engineering team to turn on, test, and pull date from each of the sensors so that we could get back data which we then communicated back to ground. It was a groundbreaking project that I was thrilled to be a part of.  The most challenging part was having not only to manage my team building software, but also communicate with the engineering side to understand what they had and what they needed.
