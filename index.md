# Coding Projects

## [ThinSat Project](https://github.com/jbernard3396/ET-Sat)
### Project Description:
Taylor University Computer Science and Engineering departments teamed up to launch the first ever student built satelite into space. The goal was to send a nano-satelite (small enough to hold with both hands) into space and test the core concept of a nano satelite, as well as some other ground breaking ideas. 
### My Job: 
I had the extreme honor of being team lead of the Software Development team. I oversaw everything from the core kernel processes to the main loop. We had to coordinate with the engineering team to turn on, test, and pull date from each of the sensors so that we could get back data which we then communicated back to ground. It was a groundbreaking project that I was thrilled to be a part of.  
### Biggest Challnge: 
The most challenging part was having not only to manage my team building software, but also communicate with the engineering side to understand what they had and what they needed.
### Highlight: 
The highlight was leading my team of software devs who had various levels of knowledge and skill and bringing them together to make an excellent product.
### Outcome: 
The project was a big success, and the satelite ended up being launched in 2019. Read more about the success of the project [here](https://cse.taylor.edu/articles/thinsat-a/)


## [Map Labeler](https://github.com/LightSys/Map-Labeler)
### Project Description: 
I volunteered with an organization called Lightsys over a January in during my junior year in college in 2018. Lightsys had a process of generating maps that did not have the location name written on the map. What they asked my team to develop was a system that would take a directory full of images, and write out new copies of those images with the image name written onto the image in a place that was both easy to read and also did not interfere with the map or write over any words that were already there
### My Job:
I worked with one other developer on the algorythm we used to process the image and determine a visually pleasing place to put the label.  After the algorytm was created, we worked with the client to meet needs surrounding effectiveness and ease of use.
### Biggest Challenge:
The biggest challenge was developing an algorythm to process the image and determine where best to put the label in an efficient manner.  We ended up implementing a concept called "memoization" whereby we used each pixel object to store information about the surrounding pixels, which cut down our runtime to nearly instant.
### Highlight: 
After we implemented the core algorythm, we were able to work closely with the clients to ensure they had all of the features, customization, and control they needed to make the project not only functional, but actually useful in the real world.  
### Outcome:
We were able to not only label all of the maps they had on hand, we also left them with a product that they can use to label maps for years to come.
